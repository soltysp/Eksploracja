Neutral;0.3333;How much of the forecast was genuine and how much was fixed, it is a moot point.
Neutral;0.3885;I did touch them one time you see but of course there was nothing doing, he wanted me.
Neutral;0.3333;We find that choice theorists admit that they introduce a style of moral paternalism at odds with liberal values.
Neutral;0.369;Well, here I am with an olive branch.
Neutral;0.5572;Its rudder and fin were both knocked out, and a four-foot-long gash in the shell meant even repairs on the bank were out of the question.
Anger;0.625;Over my dead body are you arresting him.
Neutral;0.3358;Don't let him pick a fight now, we're almost home.
Neutral;0.3571;He's a good fighter but there are certain points you can pick holes in.
Optimism;0.6115;Aggie finally found the cat a good home and from that day onwards she had kept up a running battle with her mice.
Neutral;0.2083;She left the citizens of Riverbank to their shouting match and struck off along the trail to the footpath.
Optimism;0.2;You must sink your differences.
Disgust;0.2158;Brian, as ever, decided not to sit on the fence.
Neutral;0.2158;This is turning into one of those mediaeval disputes which split hairs endlessly.
Sadness;0.2;So, you know, whilst I'm a little bit reluctant, in a way I think that's water under the bridge, and in my view actually the extension improves it all.
Neutral;0.4;In 1978, in an attempt to wipe the slate clean, Pinochet declared an amnesty to cover all human rights abuses since the coup.
Sadness;0.4;Doctors who tried to help the wounded were caught in the crossfire, and in some places ambulances also came under attack.
Optimism;0.4286;I think we need a meeting to get it laid down, we need a meeting to clear the air or not clear the air necessarily but get some definitions down.
Neutral;0.6;Hitler, of course, was dead set against a war between Britain and Germany.
Anticipation;0.3957;Well, what about the view, let me kind of play devil's advocate here against Freud and Bullett.
Aggression;0.7778;We'd fight like cat and dog.
Anger;0.3957;They were always at it, hammer and tongs you know, they had what would be called something similar to a steam hammer..
Optimism;0.2214;Er we've all got to be friends in this situation, let bygones be bygones.
Submission;0.3525;For Lisa's sake, for Celia's sake, perhaps it would be better to let sleeping dogs lie.
Anticipation;0.5904;Rugby league's deadliest rivals lock horns in the season's big curtain-raiser at Gateshead tomorrow.
Surprise;0.2158;For a brother and sister act, there was certainly no love lost between them.
Contempt;0.3525;Trust a woman to make a mountain out of a molehill.
Neutral;0.6115;Is that much ado about nothing really?
Neutral;0.5833;Well, you weren't gonna argue the toss.
Sadness;0.2;Then, in 1981, all hell broke loose in the Cambridge English Faculty.
Aggression;0.5833;Battle lines are drawn for control of the Norfolk Capital hotels group.
Neutral;0.2158;Chantal hissed, her eyes locked on his in a battle of wills.
Disapproval;0.4167;Personal appearances always seemed to be a bone of contention.
Optimism;0.5833;For once, the UK is in the good books of the European Space Agency.
Disgust;0.375;For God's sake bury the hatchet.
Anticipation;0.6;I really should er phone Breezy up and call his bluff and find out
Disapproval;0.375;I think if we knew what those heart and lung transplants cost, people would be up in arms that the National Health Service is being expected to fund that.
Disgust;0.4167;Do me a favour and get off my back.
Neutral;0.5833;Someone was saying on television, one of those, er petrol weekend things, about all the black things, and they they were saying, you know, the black a black mood.
Anger;0.3957;"It was only a suggestion, Robyn; there's no need to blow a fuse."
Neutral;0.6475;Blow a gasket.
Anticipation;0.4286;If you blow your top, they'll nick you double quick.
Anger;0.3571;You sound cheesed off, what's the matter?
Disapproval;0.3885;I would come down like a ton of bricks on imprecise ensemble, where others would readily accept the fault if the interpretation was up to it.
Anger;0.4;For crying out loud.
Surprise;0.4428;I read the paper and I saw a glow worm in it, so I cut it out and gave it to him and he stuck it up in the factory.
Submission;0.2083;Do not mention them, they would eat you alive.
Sadness;0.2083;He was fit to be tied when I separated from Hugh, and he seems to blame me for the whole thing.
Anger;0.6296;Don't fly off the handle, Ma.
Disgust;0.2;I suppose you're planning to make me foam at the mouth and gabble in obsolete tongues.
Neutral;0.7917;But notice kick the bucket appears as a verb phrase.
Anger;0.7857;It would get on my nerves.
Anger;0.5572;Oh will you give it a rest.
Aggression;0.5683;Now though, the gloves are off.
Anger;0.5926;Just as he will not tolerate questions about his private life, so he will also go ballistic if bureacrats attempt to meddle in his creative decisions.
Anticipation;0.4286;Now don't go off the deep end.
Neutral;0.4317;Old Stevenson would go spare if he knew.
Remorse;0.2083;Yeah, it's good riddance, probably.
Ambiguous;0.4;Vegetarianism is purely a matter of choice and there's no people that harp on about you shouldn't eat meat.
Anger;0.5683;Some got extremely hot under the collar about it.
Disapproval;0.4167;All right, don't jump down my throat.
Remorse;0.2158;When someone tells you the answer you kick yourself.
Disgust;0.2222;It is not particularly to make a song and dance about it.
Neutral;0.4317;So I mean you, you just mind your own business.
Anger;0.5683;Both sides, as so often in such debates, generated more heat than light.
Love;0.2;Emily has a quick temper.
Love;0.2;You normally go in and rant and rave.
Neutral;0.3571;Was it going to be a rap on the knuckles for quality?
Ambiguous;0.4;She could scream blue murder, but half an hour later would be the life of a dinner party, for she was very vain and never missed a chance to show herself off.
Neutral;0.5714;He already said he could see red and green.
Neutral;0.4167;Yanto, who would do anything for anybody who asked him nicely, also had a very short fuse when it came to insults.
Anger;0.4317;It's steamed up between the layers is that what you're looking at.
Neutral;0.4;That's what'd stick in my throat.
Disapproval;0.5572;An eighteen year old married an eighty one year old, now that is going too far.
Anger;0.3957;Well you'll take the biscuit out of the Wednesday thing won't you?
Disgust;0.4317;Surrealism was definitely the last straw.
Disapproval;0.4317;He was just about to throw a wobbly, surely the sales department should be dealing with this.
Anger;0.3957;I know you are too stupid to understand this but I will talk slowly and loudly and hope that you won't try my patience too far.
Disapproval;0.4317;Obviously you're annoyed about that letter you received - but that doesn't give you the right to vent your spleen on me.
Anticipation;0.5572;Yanto waited for a reply to his offer with bated breath.
Anticipation;0.4074;The slightest skirl of the pipes makes the retired cleaner go weak at the knees, break out in a cold sweat and shake uncontrollably.
Disapproval;0.4;Because he was a bundle of nerves, he couldn't keep still.
Disapproval;0.5833;Hopping about like a cat on hot bricks when a little reasoned thought would serve you better.
Anticipation;0.3525;The line was plucking nicely through my fingers and, with my heart in my mouth, I wound the pick up in and struck.
Optimism;0.4;Hold your breath and push, seems to work on me.
Submission;0.2;But then it's probably a case of ignorance is bliss.
Neutral;0.3957;He says you have to have nerves of steel.
Optimism;0.2;Oh that's better, got some pins and needles in my  knees.
Fear;0.6;It was just really terrible, I mean at first I was just scared stiff that I  couldn't enjoy the dance on Sunday.
Neutral;0.7917;So these are hung on tenterhooks directly hammered straight into the wall.
Surprise;0.5833;Tongue tied.
Anger;0.631;I'm at my wits end.
Surprise;0.4317;Ants in your pants, darling?
Neutral;0.5833;Once it was known that Terry Gill was wanted for questioning, a young constable who knew him, all bright eyed and bushy tailed, pointed out that his van had been parked in the car-park all day within fifty yards of the Incident Room.
Disgust;0.2158;Cause a stir if nothing else wouldn't it?
Disapproval;0.2143;Fred Klepner had been in and out of both Mark's and Pat Muldoon's offices, which were only a few yards apart, like an eager beaver.
Anticipation;0.5556;He had me on the edge of my seat a couple of times.
Love;0.2257;His performance at fever pitch.
Optimism;0.8237;I shall go the extra mile.
Disapproval;0.6238;Hold your horses then Mr Curtis.
Joy;0.6009;A bit further, give us a smile, lick your lips, Gilly.
Fear;0.2257;To begin with I found it almost too much to take on board, but it was all extremely thought-provoking and I had to make a decision to put my heart into it or not to bother at all.
Sadness;0.5933;So I can't go away in the autumn now cos that's just when everybody starts raring to go and wanting to get started on next year's programme.
Submission;0.2106;And it is I, not you, who must bear the brunt of it.
Ambiguous;0.4005;It's got nothing to do with the fact that he got bent out of shape at an early age and has been shaping laughs out of the kinks ever since.
Disapproval;0.3399;How dare you do thing like that, you know, you're sort of, you, you just can't, you're almost beside yourself, as you're trying to use up all that adrenaline, all that energy that's poured into your body as you try to help that child across the road, knowing in actual fact you can't.
Sadness;0.3871;But I was, I was bored to tears.
Contempt;0.375;You've got a chip on your shoulder about James.
Surprise;0.6051;I didn't know I could have such a good time so close to home.
Neutral;0.4151;The leisurewear industry would come apart at the seams, literally, without this indispensable fastening.
Disgust;0.3098;Lexandro felt cut to the quick, and wished he could kill this impertinent if perceptive Sergeant.
Ambiguous;0.3923;Yeah it is deep down isn't it?
Neutral;0.5978;He waited to be instructed, what else a Rifleman could do to be less like a fish out of water in a battalion of Grenadiers.
Neutral;0.5809;In a fit of pique, she'd included some wild canvases in the last show.
Disapproval;0.4242;Well despite that freudian slip there, no they don't take problem owners.
Neutral;0.2141;Try to get a grip on yourself and tell me about it.
Ambiguous;0.3887;You could get it out of your system.
Neutral;0.395;Jane could not get worked up about any car.
Ambiguous;0.3909;How did he go to pieces, when you say he went to pieces?
Contempt;0.4028;I groan inwardly at the prospect of a night playing Happy Families with a bunch of desk-jockeys and number-crunchers.
Anticipation;0.6489;Both of them were breathing hard, such a hurry and scramble of lips, hands, such a heat inside and between them, he stuffed one small breast into his mouth and then the other, giving her the same churn of astonished guilty pleasure as when she lay on her bed in the afternoons and read the forbidden books she smuggled home from the library.
Anger;0.3807;So I go, have a job to find it he just looks at me hard as nails.
Love;0.4253;"Two weeks on perfect sand in sunshine nine to five; she'd returned with an all-over tan feeling wonderful and hey presto, head over heels in love with Astrid."
Optimism;0.3889;I wonder what's brought this change of heart?
Joy;0.4215;"To fight for King and Country; to keep a stiff upper lip and a devil-may-care sangfroid, no matter if he were scared shitless."
Surprise;0.405;I was, as a newly arrived curate, somewhat taken aback and went home to lick my wounds.
Optimism;1;Look on the bright side, you managed two more than I did.
Fear;0.375;Did you have a lump in your throat?
Ambiguous;0.7804;I have very mixed feelings about it.
Optimism;0.2525;No hard feelings, darling, so nice you're getting married?
Neutral;0.3886;Since immigrants from hot countries have settled here for generations, surviving the cold, icy blast, the hybrid English, with the blood of many nations in their veins will not turn a hair at the cooler climate or the cooler neighbours.
Love;0.4282;Now that's a quick fix and hasn't cost anything, hasn't put anybody's nose out of joint.
Disapproval;0.2134;Why open old wounds?
Neutral;0.5903;Not only are characters within the tale likened to animals for instance the miller, proud as a peacock, with his skull.
Ambiguous;0.3809;Time to plan a dumpbin and regain my composure.
Disapproval;0.6171;But really, what, all they wanted to do was save face from the hospital because it wasn't our fault.
Love;0.832;The reason why I have a soft spot for this notebook, he wrote.
Neutral;0.4211;But her silence, and her eyebrows, speak volumes.
Disapproval;0.4167;We let off steam in graffiti, vandalism and football hooliganism.
Disgust;1;He won't eat dumplings, if he sees dumplings in a stew he'll puke.
Neutral;0.369;Come clean Steve. Swallow your pride.
Sadness;0.4067;He doesn't come and whisper sweet nothings in our ears.
Surprise;0.2433;Mind you, when I was skivvying for that Brixton fam'ly, the head of the fam'ly didn't' alf take a fancy to me.
Neutral;0.7933;Providing the income you will need after you stop work can take a load off your mind.
Anger;0.418;Don't tear your hair out.
Ambiguous;0.3448;Rather than wear your heart on your sleeve, you keep it under your hat.
Neutral;0.8347;So these are hangings erm hung on tenterhooks directly hammered straight into the wall.
Disapproval;0.6197;Miss H. is no more a lesbian than you are, so stop being silly and just thank your lucky stars that she's teaching Constance so much.
Love;0.783;Those two lassies, they think the world of you.
Contempt;0.401;You're unusually well informed,' Bailey said with thinly veiled sarcasm.
Submission;0.3924;Pain and nausea swept over him in waves that left him hot and sticky and weak at the knees.
Contempt;0.4284;As long as you don't die with bells on your ankles.
Optimism;0.4272;Suddenly Water Gypsy' s hitherto charming interior seemed claustrophobic, and she decided a brisk walk along the towpath might blow away the cobwebs and the fit of blues that bedevilled her
Neutral;0.2043;Chill out, Tal.
Optimism;0.5785;But I'm in my element then aren't I?
Joy;0.8279;Feast your eyes on this little dazzler a gem in a million.
Neutral;0.4337;Listen to the way he sings the phase ' Footloose And Fancy Free',
Neutral;0.369;The Jamboree was in full swing.
Joy;1;Because you know they came up, they were full of the joys of spring, looking around, chatting to their friends.
Joy;0.6374;Both of them were breathing hard, such a hurry and scramble of lips, hands, such a heat inside and between them, he stuffed one small breast into his mouth and then the other, giving her the same churn of astonished guilty pleasure as when she lay on her bed in the afternoons and read the forbidden books she smuggled home from the library.
Joy;0.4146;Ooh well they used to well they didn't used to sing a lot of songs but er they used to do a lot of you know playing about and perhaps and then they'd perhaps have a ball.
Anticipation;0.3993;But you can be sure that you'll have the time of your life.
Joy;0.6743;And mummy will have a whale of a time.
Neutral;0.4872;It's only when you let your hair down that others can see the real person hiding under the hat.
Awe;0.375;Are you always the life and soul of the party?
Neutral;0.6122;By the time they were ready to leave she was having to use every ounce of effort to convince Andr that no, she didn't want to paint the town red, or any other colour, for that matter, and no, she didn't want to have any candlelit dinners with him.
Disapproval;0.3289;So you told her you were sick and now you're going to sneak out, hoping that you'll be back before the party is over.
Surprise;0.2265;No. He was only pulling your leg.
Aggression;0.4119;Come off it, pull the other one.
Neutral;1;No punch line.
Neutral;0.6047;He is not a flamboyant man, nor is he much of a social butterfly except by comparison with the rest of his senior colleagues who tend to keep to their own counsel and lives in Barnes.
Fear;0.8127;Now take it easy, don't get panicky.
Ambiguous;0.4113;It is not clear where Sir Trevor learned to tickle the ivories.
Joy;0.8168;After that, the world is your oyster, as they say.
Joy;0.7917;For the past five days now she had been living somewhere on cloud nine, and had decided that she might just as well set up home there, as it was such a wonderful place to be.
Sadness;0.3982;Cry my eyes out, make an absolute wally of myself and now you tell me he was a Repo Man.
Sadness;0.7743;so, he said that she's feeling a bit down in the dumps and quite moody.
Joy;0.5991;That erm, made me laugh because he said to his secretary, erm, you know, I I honestly don't think your time is she is so down in the mouth.
Joy;0.2214;To pretend as the sister said, that because she and another sister share lesbian sexuality, that that is the only thing, I think is living in a fools paradise.
Joy;0.6014;They're going to have to come out of the forests,' he replied, with a grin like a Cheshire cat.
Ambiguous;0.3979;He seemed as happy as Larry trailing round the greasy dustbins of Bristol till nuclear war broke out or the police nabbed him for pilfering a used Tesco bag.
Neutral;0.445;I wish I could happy go lucky like that.
Sadness;0.4163;The voice sings along with the song, then turns into a hum. Your heart sinks. You were hoping he was alone in the house.
Joy;0.4225;Female speaker I jump for joy... but until I hear from the Foreign Office or from Martin, I won't believe it.
Joy;0.3342;I suppose that comments like that are music to your ears?
Optimism;0.4119;Never look back, Gerry always said.
Neutral;0.2141;It's a little lad and I looked through a window, I could see Judith holding this baby but you had to walk round to get to her and I knew before you'd got there and you were all over the moon about this little baby and everything.
Joy;0.7904;She was not quite sure what all of them were laughing about but there they were, rolling about with mirth, and Herbert Fraser looking as pleased as Punch.
Disapproval;0.6705;Everybody else was in raptures. And I thought, oh not Norma.
Disapproval;0.5008;So, though there are no stars in your eyes, you consider yourself beyond temptation?'
Joy;0.5591;Constance was in seventh heaven, the dresses, the hats, the model girls, everything appeared perfect to her.
Joy;1;Oh Tilly was thrilled to bits with that little that little plastic thing.
Joy;1;I'm tickled pink. If I wasn't, I wouldn't have kept quiet about you and him, would I?
Disapproval;0.4382;These are things you can't afford to lose, not at this time of your life.
Joy;1;Erm since we've got together we, we are on top of the world.
Joy;1;You feel, at the end of the treatment you feel as if you're walking on air.
Anger;0.4089;I will go bananas.
Disapproval;0.5716;We have gone from being the bread basket of Central America to being its basket case.
Contempt;0.4231;Some philosophers know a lot about bells and think that everyone who hears ringing noises in their ears must have bats in the belfry.
Ambiguous;0.5932;Oh, just thinking, I'm not all there.
Sadness;0.4;It may very well be that I'm not playing with a full deck.
Anticipation;0.375;If you think about it long enough you'll go nuts.
Disapproval;0.3891;You're off your rocker.
Disgust;0.3545;I swear you have a screw loose.
Remorse;0.3684;I must have gone stark raving mad.
Sadness;0.2142;I'm gonna get stir crazy not being able to play badminton I know, and I score, it's gonna drive me crazy.
Neutral;0.3804;It may well be necessary to botch up repairs using hurdles, bedsteads, corrugated iron sheets, scraps of wire netting, and baler twine.
Remorse;0.5051;It is now time, however, that I eat my words.
Remorse;0.3913;Freudian slip there.
Disapproval;0.3993;Come clean Steve, swallow your pride.
Neutral;0.5929;It was involved with your trial and error and practice, but it was certainly involved with Vicky and that is watching, or learning from okay.
Neutral;0.4113;This picture of Dreadnought was so wide of the mark that Willis found it better to say nothing, simply making a gesture which had something in common with a petty officer's salute.
Submission;0.3858;Servants bow and scrape.
Neutral;0.4028;Yes, the done thing for driving horses to canter or gallop on the road, they never ever should.
Contempt;0.4208;They didn't switch off when he played bloody hell with' em, excuse my French er President, but this is how it went, he couldn't give a damn about you bloody lot, he kept the television on, it just showed his frustration.
Ambiguous;0.6148;Of course, en suite has long been de rigueur, if you'll pardon my French, in hotels nationwide.
Disapproval;0.6602;So watch your language.
Contempt;0.3993;Don't overstep the mark too far, Mr Calder.
Neutral;0.5813;Did I speak out of turn?
Anger;0.6;Come on now, Malachi, don't stand on ceremony here at home.
Neutral;0.2217;So they find your particular weakness, your Achilles heel and they'd go for that.
Neutral;0.4337;The government takes the view that President Clinton was simply addressing domestic critics of his foreign policy and that his complaints shouldn't set the alarm bells ringing.
Disapproval;0.7873;Or an electric fire then you would be asking for trouble because you'd be trying to draw out.
Neutral;0.5899;Someone came out of The Two Pheasants and latched the door back to the wall hospitably.
Submission;0.2105;At which point she unlocked her ball and chain.
Sadness;0.375;The fuel gauge had gone on the blink shortly after the start.
Disapproval;0.8192;Anyway, it's a bit of a can of worms that to be quite honest
Neutral;0.3953;In the Army someone has to carry the can.
Neutral;0.6041;They're in a Catch 22 situation.
Disapproval;0.2211;There's always a chill wind blowing off that river.
Optimism;0.4225;The only cloud on the horizon was a boy called Dennis Dawson.
Disapproval;0.8213;That needn't of come to a head like that really.
Optimism;0.805;Tomorrow, I promise, come hell or high water.
Optimism;0.3939;It'll come out in the wash I guess.
Disapproval;0.3937;She was a kind of Stakhanovite worker in the field of female suffering, setting new targets for pain, finding each week some new emotional cross to bear.
Optimism;0.392;We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Neutral;0.3862;Ah, that is the crux of the matter, is it not?
Trust;0.2265;It's alright but you get to the bottom of those stairs and sometimes feel lost.
Sadness;0.2083;It's an embarrassing thing for a fault-tolerant vendor to have to say, but a bug in Guardian for the Tandem Computers Inc NonStop CLX machines caused them to reset their clocks to December 1,1983 on November 1, causing systems with time-dependent programs to go haywire.
Optimism;0.6067;When the going gets tough, it's these people who react best.
Disapproval;0.2127;But sometimes you grasp at straws.
Disapproval;0.3971;Cambridge were left high and dry for a time this afternoon as Oxford followed in the footsteps of many a champion.
Sadness;0.5833;She was in dire straits.
Remorse;0.4189;I don't want to leave him in the lurch
Neutral;0.2105;Yeah, very much a last resort and it's usually, erm as a result of ill treatment.
Optimism;0.3858;In fact, you're a girl who's going places -- once you've untied yourself from this man who's been like a millstone around your neck for the last four years.
Fear;0.4211;Get that tray along to the study, or there'll be murder to pay.
Neutral;0.412;They viewed such methods as a necessary evil, unavoidable yet somehow beneath their dignity.
Optimism;0.6287;The Economist circulation is now five hundred and twenty five thousand each week, and although their er year is out of sync with ours, I expect the profits for the year to be at or near record levels once again.
Disapproval;0.5972;I think that everyone seems to pass the buck.
Optimism;0.5723;If you are in a pickle, don't worry about it, because you can always phone Di up.
Optimism;0.4013;Yeah, if at the end of the day it's a quick fix then.
Sadness;0.8047;The Bookman put on a brave face and smiled, but Endill knew there was nothing to smile about.
Joy;0.6201;But we are saved by the bell.
Sadness;0.4226;Trained as they were, the psychiatrists on the screening tests had failed to scratch the surface of her most secret place.
Disapproval;0.3878;I put a spanner in the works of one of the companies that later merged to form Spinward.
Anger;0.426;You spell trouble, and I want you out of the way.
Surprise;0.2105;The cost of redeveloping a dilapidated shopping arcade into flats could spiral out of control, a councillor has warned.
Neutral;0.4028;If he wasn't there then I would say that you you'd be on a sticky wicket, because most terms of employment say that if you er have a driving licence and you lose it then your employment will automatically finish.
Optimism;0.2043;But why stir up a hornet 's nest by accusing Erdle when murder hasn't been mentioned?
Disapproval;0.4162;The game desperately needs a strong Leeds but if they don't stop the rot soon they can say goodbye to a top eight place, let alone the top.
Anticipation;0.5833;And that we don't want to put up anything that'll be a stumbling block, to people coming.
Ambiguous;0.5574;So you take the bull by the horns or you don't.
Anticipation;0.3941;So we now take the easy way out by using gas which we carry with us.
Neutral;0.3852;She paused for a moment to watch Rose, who by now resembled a tar baby stuck all over with dirty wool.
Disapproval;0.4089;The Governor admits there have been teething problems which need sorting out.
Neutral;0.5881;Mr Ridley would not be drawn on the thorny issue of rail privatisation other then to say that investment was urgently needed in Britain.
Disapproval;0.6238;Labour would throw money at industry.
Neutral;0.8247;The submersible rose higher in the dock, the overflowing sea rushing like a tide over their boots.
Fear;0.4;Eight extra bullets in a tight spot could mean the difference between life and death.
Anticipation;0.3709;Presumably that's just the tip of the iceberg.
